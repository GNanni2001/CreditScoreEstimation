# Bayesian Network for the estimation of Credit Score

This project aims to build a Bayesian Network, starting from a preconstructed dataset that has been pruned of some elements due to complexity issues, to observe the influence of different factors in the estimation of Credit Score.
The dataset used is taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/conorsully1/credit-score/data
